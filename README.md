# Medical-Data-Visualizer

This repo saves the third project to complete the Data Analysis course in FreeCodeCamp.org. This project is about a Medical Data Visualizer in Python, with help of matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas libraries.

# Abstract 

In this project we can visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations and its structure is static.

# Data Description

The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices. We will use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.
